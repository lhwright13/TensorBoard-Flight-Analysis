## Project Overview

### Mission Statement
Create a custom TensorBoard plugin that provides 3D flight trajectory visualization with Tacview-inspired features, specifically designed for analyzing RL pilot agents during training.

### Key Objectives
- **Seamless Integration**: Works natively within TensorBoard workflow
- **RL-First Design**: Built specifically for reinforcement learning metrics
- **Real-time Analysis**: Visualize flight behavior as training progresses
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Compare multiple agents/policies simultaneously
- **Training Evolution**: Show how flight behavior improves over time

### Target Users
- RL researchers training flight control agents
- Aviation engineers using ML for control systems
- Students learning flight dynamics and RL
- Anyone debugging/analyzing agent behavior in continuous control tasks
